Holistic wrassles bears in it's spare time.

Your tickets are nothing.

Holistic is the bug tracking software you are looking for. We weren't happy with the offerings available. So we said: Who better to make an awesome bug tracker than the people who use them? While we were at it we decided to also make it the best looking bug tracker. We took all the experience we've gained creating great web applications and made one for ourselves.

Taking Everything Into Account

Making great software is about working together. Be it working with your development group, your customer service reps or your marketing department. Holistic was created to make those relationships work even better. It's features make it easier than ever for the whole company to stay informed. From the individual developer to highest executive.
